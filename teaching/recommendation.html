Requesting a recommendation letter from Joe P. Chen

<h2>Requesting a recommendation letter from <a href="../">Joe P. Chen</a></h2>

<hr>

<p>
<b>***Please read these instructions carefully***</b>
<br></br>

Firstly, thank you for requesting a recommendation letter from me.<br>
By its very nature, it is a letter meant to recommend you for your application to the appropriate program or job.<br>
Therefore, if I do not feel confident enough to write at least a good letter on your behalf, I will politely decline your request.<br>
(A tepid or weak letter does no good to you or me. It would be better if you can find another person that can vouch for your credentials.)
<br></br> 

<b>Surefire ways</b> to make me happy to write a letter for you:<br>
<ul>
<li>You took a course with me for at least one semester, and received excellent grades and/or made a strong impression on me.</li>
<li>You did a research project with me, and I can vouch for your research / problem-solving / communication skills.</li>
<li>If you did so well to become my co-author on a publishable paper, then I have little reason not to recommend you strongly.</li>
</ul>


Situations where I will most likely <b>decline</b> to write a letter:</br>
<ul>
<li>You took a course with me, and received a grade lower than a B.</li>
<li>The program / job you are applying to is too distant from the scope of my letter.<br>
 Realistically, I can only comment on your performance in the class you took with me, or the research project you did with me.<br>
Unless you can provide further information about your goals and/or the mission of the program you are applying to, I would not stray from the above.<br>
(And even if I do, it will only be a short addendum.)</li>
</ul>

Depending on the purpose of your request, my standards for accepting it differ.<br></br>
Roughly speaking, in order of increasing standards:<br></br>
<b>Reference for job application < Colgate-internal reference < Masters program application < Fellowship application = PhD program application.</b><br></br>
