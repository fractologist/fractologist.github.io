Requesting a recommendation letter from Joe P. Chen

<h2>Requesting a recommendation letter from <a href="../">Joe P. Chen</a></h2>

<hr>

<p>
<b>***Please read these instructions carefully***</b>
<br></br>

Firstly, thank you for requesting a recommendation letter from me.<br>
<b>By its very nature, it is a letter meant to recommend you for the appropriate program or job.</b><br>
Therefore, if I do not feel confident enough to write at least a good letter on your behalf, I will politely decline your request.<br>
(A tepid or weak letter does no good to you or me. It would be better if you can find another person that can vouch for your credentials.)
<br></br> 

<b>Surefire ways</b> to make me happy to write a letter for you:<br>
<ul>
<li>You took a course with me for at least one semester, and received excellent grades and/or made a strong impression on me.</li>
<li>You did a research project with me, and I can vouch for your research / problem-solving / communication skills.</li>
<li>If you did so well to become my co-author on a publishable paper, then I have little reason not to recommend you strongly.</li>
</ul>


Situations where I will most likely <b>decline</b> to write a letter:</br>
<ul>
<li>I hardly know you from any academic context.</li>
<li>You took a course with me, and received a grade lower than a B.</li>
<li>The program / job you are applying to is too distant from the scope of my letter.<br>
 Realistically, I can only comment on your performance in the class you took with me, or the research project you did with me.<br>
Unless you can provide further information about your goals and/or the mission of the program you are applying to, I would not stray from the above.<br>
(And even if I do, it will only be a short addendum.)</li>
<li>You asked me as a "last resort" coming up against the application deadline. (Don't ask how I could tell---it's happened.)</li>
</ul>

Depending on the purpose of your request, my standards for accepting it differ.<br>
Roughly speaking, in order of increasing standards:<br></br>
<b>Reference for job application = Colgate-internal reference < Masters program application < Fellowship application = PhD program application.</b><br></br>

<b>Some DOs and DON'Ts:</b>
<ul>
<li>Once I agreed to write a letter, <b>DO</b> send me your latest resume/CV, a personal statement, and any other information that will help me craft a strong letter on your behalf.
<li>You may wish to send an unofficial transcript, though it is not absolutely necessary.
<li><b>DO</b> give me at least a week's heads-up before the letter is due.
<li><b>DON'T</b> ask me to write a letter last-minute (say, due in 48 hours). I will not be able to write a strong letter in such a short time. Even worse, you may risk my not writing it at all.
<li>Where applicable, <b>DO</b> waive your rights to access the recommendation letter. I take my letters seriously, and do my very best to give an honest appraisal of your credentials.
</ul>

All of these come back to the first point I made: <b>A recommendation letter is meant to recommend you for the appropriate program or job.</b><br>
When you present yourself as a strong, worthy candidate, it makes my recommendation all the more convincing and delightful.


<br></br>

<b>Best of luck with your application!</b>

<br></br>
