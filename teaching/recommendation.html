Requesting a recommendation letter from Joe P. Chen

<h2>Requesting a recommendation letter from <a href="../">Joe P. Chen</a></h2>

<hr>

<p>
<b>***Please read these instructions carefully***</b><br>

Firstly, thank you for requesting a recommendation letter from me.
By its very nature, it is a letter meant to recommend you for your applications to the appropriate program or job.
Therefore, if I do not feel confident enough to write a good to strong letter on your behalf, I will politely decline your request.
(A tepid or weak letter does no good for you or me. It would be better if you can find another person that can vouch for your credentials.)
<br></br>
