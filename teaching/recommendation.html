Requesting a recommendation letter from Joe P. Chen

<h2>Requesting a recommendation letter from <a href="../">Joe P. Chen</a></h2>

<hr>

<p>
<b>***Please read these instructions carefully***</b><br>

Firstly, thank you for requesting a recommendation letter from me.<br>
By its very nature, it is a letter meant to recommend you for your application to the appropriate program or job.<br>
Therefore, if I do not feel confident enough to write at least a good letter on your behalf, I will politely decline your request.<br>
(A tepid or weak letter does no good for you or me. It would be better if you can find another person that can vouch for your credentials.)
<br></br> 

<b>Surefire ways</b> to make me happy to write a letter for you:<br>
<ul>
<li>You took a course with me for at least one semester, and received excellent grades and/or made a strong impression on me.</li>
<li>You did a research project with me, and I can vouch for your research / problem-solving abilities. (If you become my co-author on a publishable paper, then even better.)</li>
</ul>
