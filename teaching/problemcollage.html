<h2><a href="../">Joe P. Chen</a>'s Handcrafted Creations of Probability Problems</h2>

<img src="iPadCoffee.jpg" width="480">


<p class="ex">This web page is a collection of probability problems I have created in connection with timely events which happened
at UConn and elsewhere, since 2013. These were actual exam problems or homework problems given in the classes I have taught.<br></br>

Due to their short shelf lives, I do NOT use these problems again in subsequent semesters (with the exception of the Sara's Pockets problem). This is one reason why I am happy to 
publicize them.<br></br>

If you have any question or comment about these problems, please email me at joe-dot-p-dot-chen@gmail (replace the -dot- by the actual dot, and add
the dotcom at the end). Please feel free to adapt any of these problems for your own courses. (Again, please beware that these problems can be dated
and do not apply to your own schools or settings.)
