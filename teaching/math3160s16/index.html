 <li> <b>Prerequisites:</b> Solid mastery of calculus, up to and including series, limits, partial differentiation, and multiple integration.</li><br>
 <li> <p class="ex">This section will be taught <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flipped_classroom">"flipped classroom" style</a>. This means that you will be responsible for watching video lectures on upcoming topics BEFORE each class meeting. This will enable us to spend more class time actively engaged in solving problems and more two-way discussions.</p></li><br>

 <li> <p class="ex"><font color="red"><b>**ENROLLMENT INFO**</b> (UPDATED 01/21/2016): Due to seat capacity issues, this section is closed to enrollment, and no permission numbers will be issued.
<!-- 
<ul>
 <p class="ex">Through January 20, 2016 (the first class meeting), enrollment will take place strictly on <a href="https://student.studentadmin.uconn.edu/">Student Admin</a> and on
 the <a href="https://www.math.uconn.edu/Surveys/WaitingList/">math department waiting list</a>. Do not ask the instructor for permission numbers. They will not be granted before the first class.</p>
 <p class="ex">Due to the <a href="http://classrooms.uconn.edu/engineering-ii-321">limited seating capacity of the classroom</a>, the enrollment cap for this section will be strictly enforced, in order to ensure the quality of instruction.</p>
 <p class="ex">Students who have not passed multivariable calculus (MATH 2110, MATH 2130, or equivalent) by the end of Fall 2015 are strongly discouraged
 from enrolling in MATH 3160. [Starting in Fall 2016, MATH 2110 will officially become a hard prereq for MATH 3160.]</p>
 <p class="ex">Anyone who wishes to enroll in this section, but is unable to register on Student Admin by January 19, must attend the first lecture on January 20, 2016. There is no guarantee that everyone who attends will receive a permission number. However, if you do not attend the first lecture, then you forfeit your chance of being considered for an opening.</p>
 <p class="ex">If there are more students than openings available, priority for admission will be determined by grades in calculus courses. Those who have not completed multivariable calculus will be placed on low priority.</p>
 <p class="ex">Honors students are encouraged to enroll in the honors section (001) of MATH 3160, which meets MWF 11:15-12:05. As a corollary, honors conversion is NOT available in any non-honors section of MATH 3160. </p>
