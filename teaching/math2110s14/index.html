 <li> <b>Textbook:</b> <i>Calculus (w/ or w/o Early Transcendentals)</i> by William Briggs and Lyle Cochran. You will need a MyMathLab account to do the textbook assignments on-line.
 <li> <b>Course components:</b> MyMathLab assignments (10%); written assignments (15%); two midterm exams (50%); final exam (25%). Extra credits may be earned throughout the semester, details TBA.
 <li> <b>Synopsis:</b> This course is devoted to a careful study of differential and integral calculus in two or more variables. Mastering concepts such as vector fields, partial derivatives, and multiple integrals will allow you to further your study in higher mathematics, physics, biology, chemistry, engineering, and economics.
 <li> <b>Course expectations:</b>
 <ul>
 <li> You are expected to attend all class sessions. I will lecture on Tuesdays and Thursdays, while the Wednesday classes are devoted to cooperative problem-solving.
 <li> It goes without saying that you need to practice often in order to internalize the concepts and master the mechanics of calculus! Therefore, attack the homework assignments as early and diligently as possible! "Strike while the iron is hot." 
 <li> Form study groups! Learn how to articulate your ideas and reasonings to your classmates/friends. "The best way to learn is to teach."
 </ul>

<p>Want to ask a HW/lecture question? <b>Post your question on Piazza.</b> By doing so you save me the trouble of having to answer the same question multiple times. Plus, once your question appears on Piazza, everyone can see and respond to it, and the whole class benefits. <b>I will not respond to HW problems via e-mail.</b>
