<p class="ex"><b>Math concepts used:</b> Conditional probability. Bayes' formula.</p>

<p class="ex"><b>Background:</b> After <a href="UConnYale.html">the aforementioned loss to Yale</a>, the UConn MBB team of 2014-15 did not improve much since, and
needed a title in the American Athletic Conference (AAC) Tournament to secure an automatic bid for the NCAA Tournament. The
AAC tournament was/is played in single-elimination format: win or go home. If UConn loses at any point, they would have virtually
no chance of getting a bid for the NCAA Tournament.
</p>

<p class="ex"><b>What I did:</b> Since students at the time had just finished learning about conditional probability, I had to ask more
straightforward questions that involved nothing but conditional probability. And the problem reflected that.
</p>

<p class="ex"><b>Aftermath:</b> <a href="http://scores.espn.go.com/ncb/recap?gameId=400785259">The UConn MBB team lost to SMU in the AAC Championship game</a>, and did not get into the NCAA tournament.
</p>

<p class="ex"><b>Acknowledgements:</b> Many thanks to UConn Honors student Danielle Deschene, a former student in my multivariable calculus and probability courses,
for suggesting that I write this problem.
